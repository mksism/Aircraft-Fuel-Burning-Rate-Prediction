# Aircraft-Fuel-Burning-Rate-Prediction
 The objective of the project was to predict fuel flow rate of airplanes during different phases of a flight (Taxi, Takeoff, Climb, Cruise, Approach, Rollout). 
To predict the fuel burn rate, we used the Honeywell data from the following competition https://www.crowdanalytix.com/contests/predict-fuel-flow-rate-of-airplanes-during-different-phases-of-a-flight .
We worked only for cruise phase [‘PH’ = 5] of flight data, as it is the most crucial flight phase in terms of fuel savings .
The data dictionary of the features (=226) given in dataset was not available as the competition has been closed. Hence, we didn’t know the actual meaning of feature names but by the help of domain experts and Internet research, we were able to understand most of them.
