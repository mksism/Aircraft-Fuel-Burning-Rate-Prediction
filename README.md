# Aircraft-Fuel-Burning-Rate-Prediction
 To predict the fuel burn rate, we have used the Honeywell data from the following competition https://www.crowdanalytix.com/contests/predict-fuel-flow-rate-of-airplanes-during-different-phases-of-a-flight .
We worked only for cruise phase [‘PH’ = 5] of flight data, as it is the most crucial flight phase in terms of fuel savings .The data was given in five folders , each folder contains 200 flight instances (so total flight instances =1000).The data dictionary of the features (=226) given in dataset was not available as the competition has been closed. Hence, we didn’t know the actual meaning of feature names but by the help of domain experts and Internet research, we were able to understand most of them.
